**TcUnit** is an xUnit type of framework specifically done for [Beckhoff's TwinCAT 3](https://www.beckhoff.com/en-en/products/automation/twincat/) development environment.
It consists of a single library that is easily integrated into any existing TwinCAT 3 project.

**Easy to use**  
The framework is easy to use.
All that is needed is to download & install the library, and provide a reference to the TcUnit-library in your project, and you can start to write your test code.

**One library**  
All functionality is provided by one single library.
Add the library to your project and you are ready to go! You can either download a precompiled (ready to install) version of the library or download the source code.

**MIT-license**  
The library and all the source code is licensed according to the MIT-license, which is one of the most relaxed software license terms.
The software is completely free and you can use the software in any way you want, be it private or for commercial use as long as you include the MIT license terms with your software.
